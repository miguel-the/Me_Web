      <p>
        一振で嵐を呼ぶ、風刃に祝福された剣 = "A sword blessed by the Wind God, it can summon a storm with a single swing."
      </p>
      <p>
        Little commentary by me, suprsingly, Fujin has not made an appearance in Megaten yet, although this idea has.
        In a good amount of mainline SMT games this sword has appeared, although with slightly different spelling "風神剣"
        so this could be a reference to that.

        No versus stuff here but this is a neat reference to the "King of Kings" game made by Atlus, one of their early titles.

        This could be a reference to SMT or just convergent evolution コキュートス means Cocytus as in the ninth circle of hell, wherein the Devil lies frozen in ice
        in Dante's Inferno. This appears as a spell in some Megaten games but interestingly to me, Digital Devil Saga, which Hashino
        worked on and clearly used some ideas there for Metaphor. Thought it was interesting to bring up.
        The description says something about controlling the whole layer of Hell but we don't know
        how big that is so it does not feel very versus applicable.

        世界樹の黄金杖 = Golden Staff of the World Tree
      </p>
      <p>
        This one is interesting, this is likely a reference to Etrian Odyssey, the name mentions 世界樹 or the World Tree. 
        It is a generalized form of many myths of great trees that connect the world found in many cultures. But this
        concept is used as a key term in Etrain Odyssey, the Japanese title even has it in there: <strong>世界樹 </strong>の迷宮. 
        This acts as the only real concrete connection lore wise, and funnily enough, this precendent was created in Persona, 
        so it would be consistent to Megaten if that were the case.

      <p>
        Here Elizabeth is possessed by Zeus and he makes clear references that the world he comes from is the Etrian Odyssey world, such
        as mentioning the Yggdrasil which is important the titular World Tree, and the cheeky inclusion of odyssey. But we don't need to speculate as in "Persona Q: Shadow of the Labyrinth Official 
        Visual Materials," this is said.
      </p>

      <p>
        "This one, referred to by Director Kaneda as the "winged" version, is
         modeled after Zeus as a celestial god embodying lust and arrogance. In this 
         title, Zeus was designed under the setting that he is one of twelve 
         exceptional, elite Andros created during the great war against the 
         Deep Ones (Fukabito). Those with a keen eye will likely recognize that he is 
         based on the archetype of a certain NPC from Etrian Odyssey III.(Hyūga)"
      </p>
      <p>
        The Andros or Yggdroids in English are a type of robot in Etrian Odyssey III: The Drowned City.
        As it is stated here, this Zeus is meant to be from Etrain Odyssey.
      </p>
      <p>
        So either way, either through Persona or by itself, there is a connection.

      <p>
        Cursed Blade Nihil is the name and this is actually a continued tradition as this is referencing Osamu Tezuka's manga
        Dororo. The SMT card even mentions this referencing Osamu Tezuka, isnt that neat. This is a pretty deep cut as it has not appeared
        that many times and the spelling is a unique Megaten thing from what I could find. Although, weirdly it's used a lot in Etrain Odyssey.
