      <p>
        Little commentary by me, suprsingly, Fujin has not made an appearance in Megaten yet, although this idea has.
        In a good amount of mainline SMT games this sword has appeared, although with slightly different spelling "風神剣"
        so this could be a reference to that.

        This could be a reference to SMT or just convergent evolution コキュートス means Cocytus as in the ninth circle of hell, wherein the Devil lies frozen in ice
        in Dante's Inferno. This appears as a spell in some Megaten games but interestingly to me, Digital Devil Saga, which Hashino
        worked on and clearly used some ideas there for Metaphor. Thought it was interesting to bring up.
        The description says something about controlling the whole layer of Hell but we don't know
        how big that is so it does not feel very versus applicable. This idea has been referenced in other <a href="https://megatenwiki.com/wiki/Cocytus"> places </a>
        like being the name for one of the dungeons in the Abyss of Time in P3 or as one of the big balls Lucifer summons
        in SMT V so to me, this seems like convergent ideas.

        世界樹の黄金杖 = Golden Staff of the World Tree
      </p>
      <p>
        This one is interesting, this is likely a reference to Etrian Odyssey, the name mentions 世界樹 or the World Tree. 
        It is a generalized form of many myths of great trees that connect the world found in many cultures. But this
        concept is used as a key term in Etrain Odyssey, the Japanese title even has it in there: <strong>世界樹 </strong>の迷宮. 
        This acts as the only real concrete connection lore wise, and funnily enough, this precendent was created in Persona, 
        so it would be consistent to Megaten if that were the case.

      <p>
        Here Elizabeth is possessed by Zeus and he makes clear references that the world he comes from is the Etrian Odyssey world, such
        as mentioning the Yggdrasil which is important the titular World Tree, and the cheeky inclusion of odyssey. But we don't need to speculate as in "Persona Q: Shadow of the Labyrinth Official 
        Visual Materials," this is said.
      </p>
      <figure>
       <img src="/assests/a9.png" alt="Example diagram">

      <p>
        "This one, referred to by Director Kaneda as the "winged" version, is
         modeled after Zeus as a celestial god embodying lust and arrogance. In this 
         title, Zeus was designed under the setting that he is one of twelve 
         exceptional, elite Andros created during the great war against the 
         Deep Ones (Fukabito). Those with a keen eye will likely recognize that he is 
         based on the archetype of a certain NPC from Etrian Odyssey III.(Hyūga)"
      </p>
      <p>
        The Andros or Yggdroids in English are a type of robot in Etrian Odyssey III: The Drowned City.
        As it is stated here, this Zeus is meant to be from Etrain Odyssey.
      </p>
      <p>
        So either way, either through Persona or by itself, there is a connection.

        Cursed Blade Nihil is the name and this is actually a continued tradition of referencing Osamu Tezuka's manga
        Dororo. The SMT card even mentions this is a refrence the late great Osamu Tezuka, isnt that neat. The spelling is a unique Megaten thing from what I could find. Although, weirdly it's used a lot in Etrain Odyssey.

        All of these sword are referencing swords from Shinto tales, while nothing too specific to Megaten titles of the past
        like unqiue spelling or something (there could be visual similarity but it's so hard to find footage that I can only guess),
        all of these have made appearances in Megaten titles so I think it adds more, consistency, so to say. That it got that philosophy, it knows how to ball with da' Megaten.
      </p>

      <p>
        The first one is referencing the Kusanagi no Tsurugi (天叢雲剣), you may notice the spelling is different but it's 
        negligable in this case as the part that is different is the sword (太刀 instead of 剣) part of the kanji to specify it is in the large sword class.
        Which will be funny later because the next two do not do that so get fucked Yamato Takeru, the guy associated with using it. Fun fact about that guy though, he has appeared
        as Naoto's 2nd tier persona and as a demon in SMT IV, I don't want to link to those because it'd take 1% more work so you
        are just gonna have to look it up or trust me with your life. Also fun fact, all of these swords are related to Susanoo, in this case he found the sword.
      </p>

      <p>
        Next up is the Totsuka no Tsurugi, similar story as before, sans spelling, it da' same. 
        Although, one interesting factoid is that this sword is the ultimate sword in P4 due to the 
        story where Izanagi uses one to slice up Hinokagutsuchi after he kills his wife, Izanami, in childbirth.
        It appears in other Megaten titles, should be noted. Such as SMT V, as it appears as the sword the Nahobino
        summons out of his hand, isn't that swell. In the case for V, it is referencing the fact that Susanoo uses one of These
        swords to kill Orochi.
      </p>

      <p>
        Lastly is the Ame no Habakiri (天羽々斬), which is the proper name for the blade used to slay Orochi and just like the other two
        appears as a weapon in the series. Side note, getting any footage of the name for this weapon in Persona 5 Strikers
        was a nightmare. It is spelt in Katakana for some reason but it means the same thing.
