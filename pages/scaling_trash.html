      <h2>Aren't the demon's just references?</h2>
      <p>
        As everyone I'm sure is aware, the Devil Summoner Archetype summons demons from Megaten. And many people dismiss this
        as just references, which is already strange as this is a player character's branch of Archetype which should already clue
        one in on importance. But they do indeed make several mentions of previous titles lore to make it clear these games are connected to 
        Megaten proper.

      Here Eupha says:
      </p>
      <p>
      "The Elder often says that everything is connected through the Sea of Hearts…
      Do you think they're lending us their power through the Sea of Heart as well?"
      </p>
      <p>
      Here they make mention of <strong>心の海.</strong> This translates to the Sea of Souls 
      or Sea of Hearts (the english translations of the games uses both interchangeably). This is a pivotel concept in the persona series as all demons, shadows, personas, and humans
      are born from it and are connected via it even across time, space, and universes. Below is le' epic proof of all that, context for P2
      the Red Man comes from a different parallel universe (PQ1 and 2 are also evidence of this but it's less epic).

      All of this is to say that since Metaphor introduces the idea of the Sea of Souls being a thing
      in universe that it would no doubt have to be a part of the grander Megaten multiverse. As well as an 
      explenation for where the demons come from. Which would elevate it above being a simple reference 
      and instead a part of the world building. This is even said in an item description.

      Before I really go into the Expanse, I'd like to share a quick piece of information about
      translations. This will be fun, don't worry. 
      </p>

      <p>
      The Expanse concept has been given many names English translations, offical and unoffical.
      Terms include: Underworld, Abyss, Monster World, Dem, etc. 
      </p>

      <p>
      In the God's tongue, Japanese, it is written as <strong> 魔界 </strong> or Makai. It can be translated to something like Demon World,
      I guess since it's so generic they decided to spice it up. For the sake of this I will refer to the Expanse as Makai. Below is some important background
      information about how it translates human thoughts into big old demons.

          Now stay with me, I have more Japanese realms to talk about. So in the spin off series Devil Summoner, instead of going
          to Makai like in SMT proper, they invented a new realm called Ikai (<strong> 異界 </strong>) or the Dark Realm in the English translations.
          Think of it like an overlay in reality that allows demons to show up but still in the same location.
        </p>

       <img src="/assests/ra.png" alt="Example diagram">

    <section>
        <p>
          It's clarified in 'Shin Megami Tensei: Devil Summoner World Guidance,' 
          that the Dark Realm is connecting to Makai.

          <strong>魔界と空間が繋がった北山大学には数名の生徒と教師が残っていた。異界化は建物の中だけでなく敷地内全体に及んでいた。
          外部との連絡は閉ざされ、歩き慣れたはずの構内は迷宮と化していたため逃げ出すことは出来なかったそうだ。</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
          "At Kitayama University, Makai became spatially linked, several students and faculty were left behind.
          The change to the Dark Realm did not stop at the interior of the buildings, but spread across the entire campus grounds. All contact with the outside world was cut off, and what should have been familiar 
          walkways within the university were transformed into a labyrinth, making escape impossible."
        </p>

        <p>
          aaannnnddd finally, we can get back to Metaphor. In Hulkenberg's Archetype unlocking dialogue for 
          the devil summoner, she says this:

      <P>
        Eagle eye'd readers can tell where this is going, translated into English it would be something
        to the effect of: "Magnificent… the power of the Devil Summoner's soul, is it?
        I hear that it can even call forth beings that do not exist in this world, summoned from the Dark Realm (<strong> 異界 </strong>) itself…"

      </P>
      <P>
        Goes without saying, but this being said for the Devil Summoner Archetype makes it quite the intentional
        connection. Meaning the demons not only come from the Sea of Souls but also can come from the Dark Realm.
        Meaning SMT scaling bbbbbaaabbbyyy

        The added Japanese text there is to emphasize the nature of how Hashino is treating these things.
        For Etrian Odyssey he calls them 'homages' but when talking about the Devil Summoner
        and Soul Hackers Archetypes he refers to them differently, saying that past Atlus works are in this
        game. There is also the fact that no deeper Etrian lore is in Metaphor, there is no mention of the World
        Tree which would be like a Sea of Souls kinda deal here.

        Another piece of connecting cosmology is the mention of Atziluth and Assiah in these two item descriptions. Atziluth

        In general mainline SMT games follow a Kabbalah
        structure to Makai, Beriah and Atziluth being where Makai is, and again, Assiah being where the human world is. A thing mentioned even at the genesis of the franchise: Digital Devil Story: Megami Tensei and
        still appearing in the most recent entry, Shin Megami Tensei V for Vengeance.

        This is another example of the magic bullshit connecting to a Megaten realm, in this case all the magic and
        again confirmation it exists in the Megaten multiverse. And as an interesting piece of information, although the 
        Kabbalah is mainly a mainline thing, it is mentioned in Persona and of course Persona is a branching timeline of SMT 1
        so it's connected either way.

        Also my favorite connection being Tokyo Destinyland, which is a location in SMT 1 and is mentioned in P3 and shown in P5.
        In Persona 3 Fes Official Fan Book -My Episode- page 164 they even show a screenshot from SMT 1.

    This gonna be a long one so for the sake of a quicker load time and more readable code on my end, this
    will be on another page. Exciting stuff. What I put up will be stuff I think is valuable for versus stuff
    or that I think is neat lore. There might even be stuff that strengthens the Megaten connection wwhhhoooo knows.
